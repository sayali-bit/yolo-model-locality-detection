This repository contains a Kaggle notebook that demonstrates how to train a YOLO model (YOLOv11) to detect buildings in satellite imagery.

The training is performed entirely within a Kaggle notebook environment, with steps covering dataset setup, YOLO training, and inference.

The original dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanmojab/xview-dataset

To preprocess the dataset, run the following notebook:
xview-dataset-preprocessing.ipynb

For reference,you may refer to the following materials:
1. Preprocessing: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ollypowell/xview-dataset-to-yolo-and-coco-format
2. Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ollypowell/xview-yolo-dataset/data

Once the preprocessing is one, you may train the model using the following notebook: 
1. Filtered the dataset to retain only building images/labels : The images and txt files which do not have any buildings are removed from the dataset. 
2. Train the model using the filtered dataset: The filtered dataset is used to train the YOLOv11 model. Currently two variants of yolov11 are being used: the 20 epoch
3. Inference: The trained model is used to make predictions on the inference images. The inference images are stored in the inference-images folder.

Observation: xview dataset has much different resolution, angels, and scales. The model does not generalize well to inference data. 

Requirement: A new dataset having the same distribution as the inference images.

Running on a local system:
1. Change the paths present in the notebooks.
2. Check the output paths generated by the notebooks.
