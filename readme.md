## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that uses YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) to detect buildings in satellite imagery. The implementation is based on the xView dataset and is designed to run in a Kaggle notebook environment.

## Dataset
The project uses the xView dataset , which contains high-resolution satellite imagery with labeled objects, including buildings.

The original dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanmojab/xview-dataset

To preprocess the dataset, run the following notebook:
xview-dataset-preprocessing.ipynb

For reference,you may refer to the following materials:

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ollypowell/xview-yolo-dataset/data

## Training
Once the preprocessing is one, you may train the model using the following notebook: 
training-yolo-on-building-only-dataset.ipynb

1. Filtered the dataset to retain only building images/labels : The images and txt files which do not have any buildings are removed from the dataset. 
2. Train the model using the filtered dataset: The filtered dataset is used to train the YOLOv11 model. Currently two variants of yolov11 are being used: the 20 epoch
3. Inference: The trained model is used to make predictions on the inference images. The inference images are stored in the inference-images folder.

## Current Limitations
The model currently faces generalization challenges due to the xView dataset's varied resolution, angles, and scales compared to the inference data. The model does not perform optimally on images with different distributions than the training set.

## Future Improvements
Acquire a new dataset with distribution similar to the inference images

## Running Locally
1. Clone this repository
2. Update file paths in the notebooks to match your local environment
3. Verify output paths generated by the notebooks
4. Install required dependencies (see requirements section)
